                    The Golden Temple, or Harmandir Sahib, is the focus of a complex of buildings that form the heart of Sikhism. The temple itself occupies a small island in the center of a tank, or pool, called the Amrita Saras (“Pool of Nectar”)—the source of the city’s name—and is connected to land on its west side by a marble causeway running across the pool. Situated facing the entrance to the causeway is the Akal Takht (“Throne of the Timeless One”), the chief center of authority of Sikhism and the headquarters of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party), the main political party of the Sikhs in Punjab. On the north side of the tank is the main entrance to the complex and the Teja Singh Samudri Hall (Clock Tower), which houses the main offices of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (Supreme Committee of Temple Management), which oversees the main Sikh gurdwaras. Among several buildings on the east side of the tank are the Assembly Hall and the Guru Ram Das Langar, the latter a large dining hall that serves meals to thousands of pilgrims and other visitors each day.
