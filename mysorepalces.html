                    Mysore Palace, a sprawling three-story, gray granite, Indo-Saracenic building capped by a five-story tower that culminates in a gilded dome in the southern Indian city of Mysuru in Karnataka state. The city is home to a number of palaces, but when people talk of Mysore Palace, they are referring to this palace within a historic fort. Also referred to as the Amba Vilas. the site features cows grazing happily among the lush gardens and twelve Hindu temples that also make up the complex. The site’s history is closely linked to that of the royal family of the former kingdom of Mysore, the Wadiyar dynasty. The family ruled the area from 1399, when they first lived in a palace at Mysore, and the city became the kingdom’s capital in 1799.

While it is believed that the palace originally was built no later than 1574, the first recorded mention of a palace on the current site was in 1638. In 1793 Tippu Sultan is said to have knocked down the palace to make way for the new city of Nazarbad, and a new wooden structure was built in 1803. This palace, however, was burned to the ground in 1897 when a fire broke out during wedding festivities. The then queen regent commissioned British-Indian architect Henry Irwin to design a new palace, and work on the present palace was completed in 1912. After India’s independence in 1947, the palace came into state ownership, although part has been given over to the descendants of the former maharajas
